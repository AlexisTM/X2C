For compilation the ARM335X_Starterware_02_00_01_01 has to be installed/copied to "C:/ti".
If you want to use another directory, you have to adapt the "Include Options" settings in the project properties.

Compilation of Blinky Demo creates a new "app" file within the sub-directory "SD-bin".
Both binaries must be copied to a SD-card containing a bootable FAT32 partition.

To boot from SD-memory one has to hold button S2 pressed while powering the BeagleBone Black.
Detailed boot instructions can be found in the BeagleBone Black manual.
