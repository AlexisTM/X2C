Rising and falling time refer to a step from 0 to 1.
Entries for \textit{Tr: Rising time} and \textit{Tf: Falling time} smaller than the actual sample time will be limited to the sample time internally.

The 16- and 32-Bit fixed point implementations are based on an internal 32-Bit wide slew-rate variable while the 8-Bit fixed point implementation uses a 16-Bit wide slew-rate variable.
