Introduction
------------
The PCAN system of the company PEAK-System Technik GmbH consists of a
collection of Windows Device Drivers. These allow the Real-time connection of
Windows applications to all CAN busses that are physically connected to the PC
via a PCAN hardware.

PCAN-Basic is a simple programming interface to the PCAN system. Via one
Interface DLL it is possible to connect own applications to the Device drivers
and the PCAN hardware, to communicate with the CAN busses.

The provided drivers, the PCAN-Basic API, and the PCAN-View CAN bus Monitor
software are the feature-reduced versions of the larger software packages
PCAN-Developer or PCAN-Explorer. These can be aquired separately.
